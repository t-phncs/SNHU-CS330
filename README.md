# SNHU-CS330

## 1. How do I approach designing software?

- Throughout the course, I have learned how to utilize OpenGL API to craft a completed 3D scene. The new design skills I have gained would be graphics programming. I think the design process should be understanding user requirements thoroughly, and following them strictly to avoid compromising the project deadline or going off sideways. For project works or any works in the future, I will also adhere to that practices to make sure any things will go in the right direction including user requirements, coding structure, and the final result.  

### 2. How do I approach developing programs?

- Besides understanding how to apply which OpenGL function to use in the 3D scene, I think making the code clean and organized is a must so we can backtrack to any part without any issues. From that method, I was able to complete the final project and was able to avoid most of the repetition.
  
### 3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

- For future educational pathways, OpenGL broaden my computational graphics skill, and the knowledge that I gained from CS330 helped me understand clearly a foundation of how graphic programming is being used in the general industry, not just for gaming development. I believe it's also an entry for anyone who wants to pursue game development in the future since it reinforces the idea of how graphics programming works.
